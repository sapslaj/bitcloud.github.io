Goals
----
The eventual goal for this website will be for it to act both as a means to spread knowledge about Bitcloud to the world, as well as to act as means of discussion for the developers of Bitcloud.



Different Parts
----
We will have two sides to the website. One side will be for the developers and the other side will be for everyone else.

The public part would will act as a "PR" and front end (e.g. linking to facebook and reddit), while the developer part will have a forum, discussion, recruitment etc. It will also including things like a calender, links to the build server, code style guide, testing guide etc.
