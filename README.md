Goals
----
The eventual goal for this website will be for it to act both as a means to spread knowledge about Bitcloud to the world, as well as to act as means of discussion for the developers of Bitcloud.

There are decisions to be made about the language choice for the backend of the website.

The currently trending choices are:

- PHP
- CGI
- RAILS


Website Features
----

Forum - so that we can shift our discussions away from mailing lists. Either using another framework, or creating our own with features like notifications.

PR - We can use this as a front end to communicate to the community

Recruitment - As a means to recruit people for the team

Discussion / Chat system

Wiki - To replace the current wiki with a more functional and beautiful one.


Different Parts
----
We will have two sides to the website. One side will be for the developers and the other side will be for everyone else.

The public part would will act as a "PR" and front end (e.g. linking to facebook and reddit), while the developer part will have a forum, discussion, recruitment etc. It will also including things like a calender, links to the build server, code style guide, testing guide etc.
